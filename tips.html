Honkai 3rd Tips
</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>
- Hoard Crystals until good focus/expansion banners
<br />
<br />
- We recommend against drawing standard after 4th draw guarantee
<br />
<br />
- EXP chips affect mission EXP
<br />
<br />
- Feel free to use 25 crystals twice a day for 120 extra stamina. 
<br />
<br />
- Ensure you do all possible daily missions every day
<br />
<br />
- Rush levels early on as quickly as possible so you can participate in events
<br />
<br />
- Don't be too hesitant on using easily farmed consumables such as EXP chips, stigma and weapon Enhancement EXP items. 
<br />
<br />
- But always save honkai cores unless you know what you're doing
<br />
<br />
- Don't worry too much about skill points, they are infinite and regenerate over time
<br />
<br />
- However some valks prefer not to have their QTE skilled, such as Shadow Dash. 
<br />
<br />
- Surrender story mode quests if you don't get all 3 medals to save stamina
<br />
<br />
- Force quitting the app before you die in Abyss lets you retry the floor
<br />
<br />
- Make sure you level up your Base buildings as you go. Priority: Powercore -> Command Center -> Main character's building
<br />
<br />
- Don't salvage anything unless you're 100% sure you don't need it/won't use it. 
<br />
<br />
- Join an **active** armada as early as possible - they can help you a lot and get you currency to buy things from the Armada Shop. 
<br />
<br />
- If you're not always active in the game and let your stamina overflow, upgrade your fridge in your dorm. 
<br />
<br />
- In open world after you're finished the samsara stories, make sure to collect everything you see and aim for an S rank overall clear. Explorer's Soup helps a lot. 
<br />
<br />
- Stamina - EXP is generally a 1:1 relation. New captains get 1.5 exp per stamina, and with an EXP chip active this goes up to 2 exp per stamina. 
<br />
<br />
- Some free valks you may want to prioritize farming early on include Shadow Dash (S rank), Valkyrie Chariot (SS rank), Divine Prayer (A rank), and Miko (S rank). 
<br />
<br />
- You can use the "Sell" function to get rid of large amounts of treasures at once (instead of clicking "Use" individually)
<br />
<br />
- Some free stigmatas in the Exchange Shop to prioritize getting are:
<br />
<br />
   - Atilla B for physical melee attackers
<br />
<br />
   - Theresa Origins set for Theresa
<br />
<br />
   - Shigure Kira Top/Bottom for elemental attackers
<br />
<br />
- Avoid the Yae Sakura set in the open world shop
<br />
<br />
- Avoid the Seele set in the exchange shop unless you know that you can utilize it
<br />
<br />
- If you press Ai-chan in the bottom right corner, the tutorial quests give 15 crystals each.
