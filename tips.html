<p>
- Hoard Crystals until good focus/expansion banners

- We recommend against drawing standard after 4th draw guarantee

- EXP chips affect mission EXP

- Feel free to use 25 crystals twice a day for 120 extra stamina. 

- Ensure you do all possible daily missions every day

- Rush levels early on as quickly as possible so you can participate in events

- Don't be too hesitant on using easily farmed consumables such as EXP chips, stigma and weapon Enhancement EXP items. 

- But always save honkai cores unless you know what you're doing

- Don't worry too much about skill points, they are infinite and regenerate over time

- However some valks prefer not to have their QTE skilled, such as Shadow Dash. 

- Surrender story mode quests if you don't get all 3 medals to save stamina

- Force quitting the app before you die in Abyss lets you retry the floor

- Make sure you level up your Base buildings as you go. Priority: Powercore -> Command Center -> Main character's building

- Don't salvage anything unless you're 100% sure you don't need it/won't use it. 

- Join an **active** armada as early as possible - they can help you a lot and get you currency to buy things from the Armada Shop. 

- If you're not always active in the game and let your stamina overflow, upgrade your fridge in your dorm. 

- In open world after you're finished the samsara stories, make sure to collect everything you see and aim for an S rank overall clear. Explorer's Soup helps a lot. 

- Stamina - EXP is generally a 1:1 relation. New captains get 1.5 exp per stamina, and with an EXP chip active this goes up to 2 exp per stamina. 

- Some free valks you may want to prioritize farming early on include Shadow Dash (S rank), Valkyrie Chariot (SS rank), Divine Prayer (A rank), and Miko (S rank). 

- You can use the "Sell" function to get rid of large amounts of treasures at once (instead of clicking "Use" individually)

- Some free stigmatas in the Exchange Shop to prioritize getting are:
   - Atilla B for physical melee attackers
   - Theresa Origins set for Theresa
   - Shigure Kira Top/Bottom for elemental attackers

- Avoid the Yae Sakura set in the open world shop

- Avoid the Seele set in the exchange shop unless you know that you can utilize it

- If you press Ai-chan in the bottom right corner, the tutorial quests give 15 crystals each.
